TV Server
=========
=========

The TV server is used to control a TV card from Freevo and possible
other applications. It is split into three parts: a scheduler, a
device wrapper and a Python API to control it.

Scheduler
=========

You must have one TV server scheduler running in your network. This is
the master TV server. First create a config file:

tvserver --scheduler --genconfig

Now edit ~/.tvserver/scheduler.conf. If you have a controller like
Freevo or devices on a different machine you should set rpc.address to
a different IP address and set a rpc.password. Also set up the epg
mapping my selecting an EPG source provider. After that you can start
the TV server with

tvserver --scheduler


Device Mapper
=============

Each device must be connected to a TV server scheduler. First, create
the config by calling

tvserver --devices --genconfig

Now edit ~/.tvserver/devices.conf. Besides the found devices and their
priority there are rpc settings. Please set rpc.address and
rpc.devices to the values using by the scheduler. You may also set the
directory where to store the recordings. Now you can start the devices
mapper as standalone application or start device mapper and scheduler
in one app.

tvserver --devices
tvserver --scheduler --devices


API Interface
=============

Import tvserver in Python and you can control the scheduler with
Python code remotely. See the API doc for details.


Limitations
===========

1. Currently only DVB is supported, either using mplayer or svn from
   dvbstreamer as backend.

2. EPG Mapping of the sources channel names to the names from DVB
   devices is currently broken.

Feel free to send patches to the Freevo devel mailing list.
