Freevo TV Server


The Freevo TV Server handles recording and live tv for Freevo. It uses
freevo-tvdev to use the different card on the different machines.


1. Limitations

The EPG mapping is a little bit difficult right now, we are searching
for a better way. You also need the tv_grab helper from Freevo to get
the epg, later versions of the tvserver should include that.


2. Requirements of setup



3. Basic setup

To setup freevo-tvserver, just start it. It will write a config file
and stop again because record.dir is not defined. Please define it in
the config file and check the file for other possible changes. The
system wide config file is /etc/freevo/tvserver.conf and if not
running as root, a user config file is ~/.freevo/tvserver.conf.

Also set the grabbers for the epg you want to use, e.g. xmltv in that
file. When you restart the tvserver, you can start tvserver again
(while the first one is running) with the paramater update-epg.

Now start tvserver again and it should find the running tvdev (there
should be a debug line showing the ip address and the devices, like
"add <Recorder for 15782-0@192.168.1.2:dvb0>". Two seconds later the
tvserver will stop again because he found new channels. Check the
config file again, and the end is the epg mapping containing all
channels found. Set the mapping to the correct xmltv id (there are
some mappings guessed by the system, later we want a better automatic
detection). If you don't have a mapping, just ignore the line. The
mapping should now look like this

epg.mapping[Das Erste] = ard.de
epg.mapping[Doku KiKa] = 
epg.mapping[EinsExtra] = extra.tvtoday.de
epg.mapping[Eurosport] = eurosport.de
epg.mapping[Info 3sat] = 
epg.mapping[KABEL1] = kabel1.de

Now you should be able to start the tvserver and it should not stop
again.
