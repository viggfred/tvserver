Freevo TV Server


The Freevo TV Server handles recording and live tv for Freevo. It uses
freevo-tvdev to use the different card on the different machines.


1. Limitations

The EPG mapping is a little bit difficult right now, we are searching
for a better way. You also need the tv_grab helper from Freevo to get
the epg, later versions of the tvserver should include that.


2. Limitations

Only dvb cards are working right now, normal analog cards are
detected but not working. The scanning option also does not work
correctly, you need to setup the channels.conf manually.


3. Basic setup

To setup freevo-tvserver, just start it. It will write a config file
and stop again because record.dir is not defined. Please define it in
the config file and check the file for other possible changes. The
system wide config file is /etc/freevo/tvserver.conf and if not
running as root, a user config file is ~/.freevo/tvserver.conf.

Also set the grabbers for the epg you want to use, e.g. xmltv in that
file. When you restart the tvserver, you can start tvserver again
(while the first one is running) with the paramater update-epg.
