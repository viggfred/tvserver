The channels mapping code (device names to epg names) needs much
improvement. Maybe create some share files to hold some basic mapping.

A one shot favorite will be deleted when a recording is created. But
it should only be deleted if that recording is successful and should
stay if not.

The usual: inline doc, helping doc, header cleanup (point to the
correct AUTHORS file)

Do not stop on config erros like missing record dir or new epg
mappings. Just go into idle mode and make it possible to configure the
server over rpc (e.g. with the webserver)

The interactive mode needs much more work

Maybe rename the start script. The name freevo-tvserver is too
long. It could be freevo-tvsrv or even only tvserver or tvd.

When kaa.epg is replaced by kaa.epg, move all the epg grabber logic
into this module or kaa.epg. The tv_grab helper should be removed in
freevo ui.
