When starting live-tv the server uses the best possible recorder
without checking if it is busy right now. This could kill a current
running recording.

The channels mapping code (device names to epg names) needs much
improvement. Maybe create some share files to hold some basic mapping.

Some mbus command are still missing, like changing a favorite

A one shot favorite will be deleted when a recording is created. But
it should only be deleted if that recording is successful and should
stay if not.

The usual: inline doc, helping doc, header cleanup (point to the
correct AUTHORS file)

Create a small doc how the mbus commands work so that it is possible
to use the tvserver outside Freevo (e.g. with a gtk app using gmbus).

Do not stop on config erros like missing record dir or new epg
mappings. Just go into idle mode and make it possible to configure the
server over mbus (e.g. with the webserver)

The interactive mode needs much more work

Maybe rename the start script. The name freevo-tvserver is too
long. It could be freevo-tvsrv or even only tvserver or tvd.
